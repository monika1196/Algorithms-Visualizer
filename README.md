## 💡Lessons Learned
Searching and Sorting Algorithms
D3 Data Visualization
Asynchronous Javascript
Continuous Integration with CircleCI and Continuous Deployment with Git
## 🛠 Technologies
Front-End	Back-End	Deployment
HTML5	Flask	CircleCI
CSS3 javascript html5
Bootstrap 4	.	.
Javascript	.	.
D3	.	.
## ⚖️ Methodology
D3 Library for data visualization to both challenge myself with learning a new framework and because D3 is the ideal solution for data visualization problems
Bootstrap 4 for increasing my experience working with it and to shift focus towards spending more time on the data visualization and underlying algorithms
## ⚙️ Features
Visualize Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort
Random numbers in an array are graphed as a bar chart
The values of the array are displayed and updated in an HTML table below the bar chart
They are also accessible through a tooltip that displays the value when hovered over
The Javascript Execution times are logged in Bootstrap 4 cards to allow comparison of different algorithm runtimes and for further information on the Big-O
To Do:

Add unit testing
Allow user to specify the speed they want the algorithm to run
Add more algorithms as I progress in my studies
Expand upon the scope by incorporating data structure visualization and manipulation
